Flyway Command Line for Linux

I'm using [flyway](http://code.google.com/p/flyway/) to organize my projects migrations.

But I could not find a way to install it in my system for use across various projects.

So I made some tweaks in the command line sh for it to work on my system.

Going to keep all organized here in this repository.
